## Description

Example showcasing LightningChart Histogram visualization using Bar Chart.

In this example, a world population dataset is visualized. The dataset is from [United Nations](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/) and it includes world population by age per year.

This example includes a HTML slider input to select the year to be visualized. The chart updates automatically from these interactions. The automatic slider progression animation can be paused and replayed by pressing the space bar.
