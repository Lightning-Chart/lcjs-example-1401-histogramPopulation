This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Example on how to display Histograms with LightningChart JS.

The recommended approach is to use `ChartXY` and `RectangleSeries` features.
This can be easily combined with complementary visualizations, such as trends lines / outliers by adding additional Line/Point series to the chart.

For most up to date documentation on realizing Histogram, see [Histograms](https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/docs/features/xy/histogram/).
